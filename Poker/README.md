Poker5Card
===================

An assignment from Data Analytics Programming, taught by Adnan Aziz (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/)

Poker5Card takes two hands, and outputs the winner of the two hands. It also contains classes that will let you analyze 7-card hands for the best 5-card hand. There are some classes for doing Monte Carlo simulation, but we were not required to implement these. Someday!

I do not think this represents my best work, and I never cleaned the code. But it works. You can get an idea of how the program works by looking at the tests (written by Professor Aziz).

Part of the code was written by Professor Aziz. He created the framework, but the logical parts of the program are all mine, except for the short-circuit comparison of the hands, and some of the 7-card stuff. He also provided us with a working version of a three-card program to help us get started.
