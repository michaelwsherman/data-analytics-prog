LogAnalysis
===================

Data Analytics Programming, taught by Adnan Aziz (http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/)

log-analysis takes an input of times, webpages, and users, and outputs the pages most often viewed in combination by users. Essentially, this is the basis of a recommendation engine--a list of webpages viewed together, that could theoretically be parsed to provide suggestions to users of other pages they should visit.

However, part of the assignment was to just do this with arrays. And the code is somewhat sloppy, I have not cleaned it up. I do not think this represents my best work.

Part of the code (mostly the framework) was written by Professor Aziz, but the meat of the methods is my (sloppy) work.
